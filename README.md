# Python Programming Course – Faculty of Economics  
### Course tasks topics

During this course, students designed their own programming assignments within predefined topic boundaries. Each task was scoped to a specific theme and assigned a difficulty level.

Below is the list of core topics covered:

1. **Branching and Loops**  
2. **Strings, Files, and Exceptions**  
3. **Functions as Abstraction Mechanisms – Recursion**  
4. **Lists and Tuples**  
5. **Sets and Dictionaries**  
6. **Classes and Objects**  
7. **Inheritance and Composition of Classes**  
8. **Debugging and Testing**

### Tasks I designed
The tasks I included are either original problems from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or carefully extracted subtasks—created when the full problem was too extensive for a single exercise. All selected challenges emphasize clarity, educational value, and alignment with the corresponding topic.
